Online Recruitment Portal (Django):
Built a multi-role recruitment web application using Django, allowing public users to register, browse jobs, and apply to listings, while companies can log in to their dashboards to post job openings. Admins manage the entire platform, including job listings and user accounts. Developed core modules such as registration/login, job search, application flow, and role-based access control. Project was deployed for college use and later handed off for extended development.
